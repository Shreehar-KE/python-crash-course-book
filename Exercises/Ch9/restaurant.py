"""
9-1. Restaurant: Make a class called Restaurant. The __init__() method for
Restaurant should store two attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type.
Make a method called describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of
information, and a method called open_restaurant() that prints a message indicating
that the restaurant is open.

     Make an instance called restaurant from your class. Print the two attributes
individually, and then call both methods.

10-8. Cats and Dogs: Make two files, cats.txt and dogs.txt. Store at least three
names of cats in the first file and three names of dogs in the second file. Write
a program that tries to read these files and print the contents of the file to the
screen. Wrap your code in a try-except block to catch the FileNotFound error,
and print a friendly message if a file is missing. Move one of the files to a dif-
ferent location on your system, and make sure the code in the except block
executes properly.

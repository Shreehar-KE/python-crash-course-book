10-1. Learning Python: Open a blank file in your text editor and write a few lines
summarizing what youâ€™ve learned about Python so far. Start each line with the
phrase In Python you can. . . . Save the file as learning_python.txt in the same
directory as your exercises from this chapter. Write a program that reads the file
and prints what you wrote two times: print the contents once by reading in the
entire file, and once by storing the lines in a list and then looping over each line.
"""

"""
10-3. Simpler Code: The program file_reader.py in this section uses a temporary
variable, lines, to show how splitlines() works. You can skip the temporary
variable and loop directly over the list that splitlines() returns:

for line in contents.splitlines():

      Remove the temporary variable from each of the programs in this section,
to make them more concise.

"""
5-1. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement
describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code
should look something like this:

car = 'subaru'
print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'subaru')
print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'audi')

• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line
  evaluates to True or False.

• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another
  5 tests evaluate to False.
"""

"""
5-2. More Conditional Tests: You don't have to limit the number of tests you cre-
ate to 10. If you want to try more comparisons, write more tests and add them
to conditional_tests.py. Have at least one True and one False result for each of
the following:

• Tests for equality and inequality with strings

• Tests using the lower() method

• Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and less
  than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to

• Tests using the and keyword and the or keyword

• Test whether an item is in a list

• Test whether an item is not in a list
